# Car Fuel Efficiency Analysis

This repository contains a very small dataset `fuel.csv` which I created myself by recording each time I put fuel in my car and noting the car mileage, liters put in and cost along with other variables.

The notebook `car-fuel.ipynb` contains analysis of the data.

I plan to add utilities to calculate an expected cost of a journey based on mileage and current fuel prices.

This dataset may or may not be periodically updated, depending on if I continue to keep records.
